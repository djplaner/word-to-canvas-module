### Collections / objects / items - brief explanation

A Blackboard course that has a clear structure of 

- collections - where each left hand menu item (e.g. _Course Content_ or _Assessment__ collects together multiple common "objects" 
- objects - a menu item page clearly "collects" together muliple objects of the same type (e.g. assignments, weeks, lectures, modules) 
- items - each object consists of different components (e.g. lecture slides, tutorial sheets, links, resources etc.) 

## w2c using the CAR on Content Interface content - Access limited

Demonstration of migrating Content Interface content from Blackboard to Canvas. Starting with a Word document created by the CAR process, some modification, and then imported using word2canvas.
