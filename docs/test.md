# Test word2canvas

After you have [installed the ```word2canvas``` userscript](./install.md), use the following to test it.

The process below is

1. Prepare pre-requisites
2. View the modules page and ```word2canvas``` in action.
3. Use ```word2canvas``` to create a new module from the [firstTextDocument file](https://github.com/djplaner/word-to-canvas-module/raw/main/docs/firstTestDocument.docx)

## 1. Prepare pre-requisites

To test ```word2canvas``` you will need

1. A browser with the ```word2canvas``` userscript installed.
2. A Canvas course site on which you can create Modules.
3. Have downloaded the [firstTestDocument.docx file](https://github.com/djplaner/word-to-canvas-module/raw/main/docs/firstTestDocument.docx) to your computer.

## 2. View the modules page and ```word2canvas``` in action.

With ```word2canvas``` installed in your browser, go to the Modules page of your Canvas course. **Not** in _Student View_. You should see something similar to the following.

The new addition is the **.docx 2 + Module** button to the left of the **+ Module** button in the top right-hand corner. This button has been added by ```word2canvas```.

## 3. Use ```word2canvas``` to create a new module

Create a new module by clicking the **.docx 2 + Module** button. This should add the **.docx 2 + Canvas Module** interface at the top of the page you're viewing. e.g. the following image.
