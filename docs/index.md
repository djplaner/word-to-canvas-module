# Word to Canvas (```word2canvas```) Module

## What is ```word2canvas```?

A [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_script) that will create a new [Canvas LMS](https://www.instructure.com/en-au/canvas) module from a Word document (using some specific Word styles) - see [sample w2c.docx](https://github.com/djplaner/word-to-canvas-module/raw/main/sample%20w2c.docx) for an annotated example.

!!! Note "Your content stays in your environment"

    :exclamation: The contents of your Word documents always remain on your computer, your web browser, and eventually as a Module in the Canvas instance you are working with.

## Why use ```word2canvas```?

Manually creating a complex module using the Canvas web interface can be a touch tedious. Each item must be edited on its individual page. Multiple clicks... Especially if you already have the module content in a Word document and/or you are creating many modules. (e.g. migrating from one LMS to another)
