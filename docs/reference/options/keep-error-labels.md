# Keep error labels in Canvas content

During the conversion process ```word2canvas``` will generate a number of errors and warnings. These identify possible issues with the conversion process that may require manual intervention.

By default these labels are NOT included in the content added to Canvas. If turned on this option will include the error labels in the generated Canvas content. The purpose being to make it easier for you to identify what needs to be fixed.
